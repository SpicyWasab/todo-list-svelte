# Todo-List PWA in SvelteKit 

## What is this ?
This is a simple todo-list Progressive Web Application I made during a week on summer vacations.
I wanted to learn PWA for mobile development, as well as Svelte-Kit (which is a cool web framework !) and IDB.

## Where can I try this ?
Right there !

As mentioned earlier, this is a PWA, so it's better to use a smartphone.
It's installable and can work offline thanks to a Service Worker (not sure about IOS compatibility though, but it should work on recent versions of IOS).
The website is also entirely hosted on github pages, and your notes are stored in local storage / IDB. They're not sent to the server in any means !
